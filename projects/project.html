						Over the summer I built a 4x4x4 LED Cube. The LED cube uses an Arduino Uno micro-controller to program the LEDs. The code that I used in the video along with additional pictures, can be viewed by clicking the link below.</h5>

					<h3 class="project-title">BarBot</h3>
					<h5 class="description">with Shreya Hirday, Shaantam Chawla, and Nishanth Shanmugham</h5>
					<br>
					<h5 class="description">BarBot utilizes a combination of Android and Arduino to create a magical Box that stores your temptations and keeps you from simply taking TOO MUCH. Well, it first started off as an idea for a robot that could move around and carry drinks for people at a party. Each person gets a limited numbers of drinks, and once that limit is reached...BarBot doesn't let you take anymore! We later expanded this idea to eating healthy as well. One of our favorite key features is that BarBot can automatically lift its cover so you can take what you went simply using sonar data. Another key feature that we like is that the Android app keeps track of how much you have had...and no registration required!</h5>
